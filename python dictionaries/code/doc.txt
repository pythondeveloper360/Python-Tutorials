Python dictionary is an ordered collection of items. It stores elements in key/value pairs. Here, keys are unique identifiers that are associated with each value.
Here is an example of capitals

=> Example 1
Pakistan -> Islamabad
USA -> Washington DC
Enland -> London
dict(Pakistan = "Islamabad")

=> Example 2
1 -> One
2 -> Two
3 -> Three
{1:One}

1)Create a dictionary of countries and their capitals. Ask the user to enter a country, and return the capital of that country. If the country is not in the dictionary, return "Sorry, we don't have information about that country."












2)Write a program to find the word frequency in a given sentence using a dictionary. For example, if the sentence is "I love python programming language", the output should be a dictionary with each word as a key and its frequency as the value.













3)Write a program to find the maximum value in a dictionary.













4)Create a dictionary containing the names of students and their scores in a class. Write a program to print the name and score of the student with the highest score.













5)Create a dictionary containing the names of fruits and their prices. Write a program to print the total cost of purchasing 5 bananas, 3 apples, and 2 mangoes.













6)Write a Python program to print a dictionary in table format. For example:

students = [
    {"name":'Alice',"age":12,"gender":'female'},
    {"name":'Bob',"age":15,"gender":'male'},
    {"name":'Charlie',"age":11,"gender":'male'},
    {"name":'David',"age":13,"gender":'male'},
    {"name":'Emma',"age":16,"gender":'female'},
