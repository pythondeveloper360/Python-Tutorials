Python has several built in libraries,
we will discuss about some of them today.










==> math module
provides access to the mathematical functions.







--math.ceil(x)
Return the ceiling of x, the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.














--math.floor(x)
Return the floor of x, the largest integer less than or equal to x










math.factorial(n)
returns the factorial
#implementation









math.comb(n, k)
Return the number of ways to choose k items from n items without repetition and without order.
Evaluates to n! / (k! * (n - k)!) when k <= n and evaluates to zero when k > n.
Also called the binomial coefficient because it is equivalent to the coefficient of k-th term in polynomial expansion of (1 + x)ⁿ.


















math.lcm(*integers)
Return the least common multiple of the specified integer arguments. If all arguments are nonzero, then the returned value is the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of all arguments. If any of the arguments is zero, then the returned value is 0. lcm() without arguments returns 1.

              !!!!!!!new in version 3.9!!!!!!!


















math.prod(iterable, *, start=1)
Calculate the product of all the elements in the input iterable. The default start value for the product is 1.









math.e
The mathematical constant e = 2.718281…, to available precision.

math.pi

    The mathematical constant π = 3.141592…, to available precision.











math.log(x, base = math.e)
With one argument, return the natural logarithm of x (to base e).
With two arguments, return the logarithm of x to the given base, calculated as log(x)/log(base).

















math.sqrt(x)
    Return the square root of x.
#implementation




















math.degrees(x)

    Convert angle x from radians to degrees.

math.radians(x)

    Convert angle x from degrees to radians.











math.cos(x)
    Return the cosine of x radians.

math.sin(x)

    Return the sine of x radians.

math.tan(x)

    Return the tangent of x radians.


















==> Random module
built-in module that you can use to make random numbers or choices.










random.seed(a)
print(random.random())
the generator creates a random number based on the seed value, so if the seed value is 10, you will always get 0.5714025946899135 as the first random number.












animals = ["Lion", "Gorilla", "Tiger", "Elephant", "Bear", "Cheetah", "Hippopotamus", "Rhinoceros", "Giraffe", "Zebra"]


-shuffle(seq)
Shuffle the sequence.








animals = ["Lion", "Gorilla", "Tiger", "Elephant", "Bear", "Cheetah", "Hippopotamus", "Rhinoceros", "Giraffe", "Zebra"]

-choice
Return a random element from the non-empty sequence seq









random.randint(a,b)
Return a random integer between a and b













==> getpass module (Portable password input)









-getpass.getpass(prompt='Password: ')
prompt the user for a password without echoing(showing)










-getpass.getuser()
returns the login name of the user
